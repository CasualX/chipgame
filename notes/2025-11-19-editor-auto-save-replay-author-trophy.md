# Auto-save best time and author trophy from editor play

When a level is played and completed from the editor, automatically record the run as a replay and track the best time as an “author trophy” target.
Each successful editor play should be compared to the stored best, replacing the embedded replay and metadata when a better result is found.
This ties together design and playtesting so the level file itself carries the creator’s reference run.

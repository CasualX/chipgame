# Explicit monster order

In some levels, the order in which monsters spawn affects gameplay significantly.
I would prefer this not to be the case, but fixing this is a slow and difficult process.
In the meantime allow monster order to be explicitly visualized and edited in the level editor.

[ ] Visualize monster order in the editor, with a little number next to each monster indicating its spawn order.\
[ ] Allow reordering monsters in the editor by dragging these numbers up and down.\

Fix known game code issues where monster order is not respected:

[ ] Trap entities before brown button presses are processed.\

The elephant in the room is monster movement and collision order...

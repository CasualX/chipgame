# Levelsets

Levelsets are collections of levels that can be played in the game.

## Installing levelsets

To install a levelset, download the levelset file and place in this directory. The levelset file should have a `.pak` extension.

Alternatively the levelset files can be placed in a subdirectory. The levelset will be loaded if the subdirectory contains a `index.json` file.

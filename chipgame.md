Chip's Challenge Remake
=======================

This is a remake of the classic game [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge), loosly based on the release for Windows 3.1 version of the game. The game is a top-down puzzle game where the player controls Chip, a computer chip, as he navigates through a series of levels collecting computer chips and keys to unlock the exit.

Levelsets
---------

When the game is started, the player is presented with a menu to select a levelset to play.

* [Chip's Challenge](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge): Play the original levels from the game for the feeling of nostalgia.
* [Chip's Challenge Level Pack 1](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Chip%27s_Challenge_Level_Pack_1): Play this first if you're a newcomer to the game.

Additional levelsets can be installed in the `levelsets` directory.

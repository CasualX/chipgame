Chip's Challenge Remake
=======================

This is a remake of the classic game [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge), loosly based on the release for Windows 3.1 version of the game. The game is a top-down puzzle game where the player controls Chip, a computer chip, as he navigates through a series of levels collecting computer chips and keys to unlock the exit.

---------

When the game is started, the player is presented with a menu to select a levelset to play.

Start by playing Chip's Challenge Level Pack 1, it is designed specifically for beginners to learn and experience the basics of the game before moving on to more challenging levelsets.

In the context of Chip's Challenge, DAT or .dat is the file format which Chip's Challenge 1 level sets are commonly stored in, named for the CHIPS.DAT file containing the levels for MSCC. The .dat extension is short for "data" and commonly used on data files with ad-hoc formats; it is not specific to Chip's Challenge.

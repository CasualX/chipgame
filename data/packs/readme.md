# Level Packs

Packs are collections of levels that can be played in the game.

## Installing Packs

To install a pack, download the pack file and place it in the `packs` directory in the game's data directory. The pack file should have a `.pak` extension.

Alternatively the files can be placed in a subdirectory of the `packs` directory. The pack will be loaded if the subdirectory contains a `index.json` file.
